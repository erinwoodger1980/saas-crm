### SECTION 1.3: Heritage Sash Clarification (IMPROVED)

**BEFORE:**
```
Box Sash Windows
Traditional pulley and cord sash windows engineered to conservation standards.
• Counterweighted operation with pulleys and cords
• Slimline vacuum glazing for heritage compliance
• Traditional horns and decorative glazing bars
• Conservation-approved profiles and detailing

Spring Balance Sash Windows
Classic sash appearance with spring mechanisms instead of weights.
• Slimmer frame depth (no weight box required)
• Smooth spring balance operation
• Heritage detailing and slim profiles
• Suitable for conservation areas
```

**AFTER:**
```
Box Sash Windows
Full traditional sash operation with concealed counterweights in box frames. Essential for Georgian, Victorian, or Edwardian properties requiring authentic vertical sliding operation.

Key features:
• Hidden counterweights with traditional pulleys, cords, and pulleys visible on opening
• 75mm slim frames with vacuum glazing (6.15mm thick) for heritage compliance
• Traditional horns, staff beads, and decorative glazing bars to conservation officer standards
• Draught-sealed meeting rails with concealed weather seals
• Hand-finished mouldings and period-correct detailing
• Suitable for listed buildings and strict conservation areas

When to specify: Original sash windows in poor condition, full property restoration, conservation area compliance required.

Spring Balance Sash Windows
Authentic sash appearance with concealed spring mechanisms instead of counterweights. Ideal where box frames can't fit—extensions, upper floors, tight reveals, or flat conversions.

Key features:
• Slimmer 65mm frame depth (no weight box required)
• Smooth spiral spring balance operation—easier than traditional cords
• Identical external appearance to box sash (horns, glazing bars, profiles)
• Vacuum or slimline double glazing options
• Draught-sealed and weather-tested to BS 6375
• Suitable for conservation areas (approved by most planning authorities)

When to specify: Modern extensions matching period property, upper floor installations, where full box construction isn't feasible.

Difference explained: Box sash uses hidden weights and pulleys (authentic 18th/19th century mechanism). Spring balance uses concealed springs (identical appearance, easier operation, narrower frames). Both achieve conservation approval—box sash is essential for listed buildings requiring authentic mechanisms.
```

**WHY:** Lignum explains "when to choose" very clearly. Homeowners and architects need to understand the practical difference—not just features. Added frame depths (75mm vs 65mm), explained mechanisms clearly, added "When to specify" guidance.

• 58mm slim sightlines with double or vacuum glazing (U-value 0.49–0.9 W/m²K)
• Discreet friction stay hinges or traditional butt hinges
• PAS 24 security: multi-point locking with shootbolts and concealed keeps
• Suitable for conservation areas (approved flush profile maintains period character)
• 10-year factory paint finish guarantee

When to specify: Listed buildings requiring discreet replacement, Georgian or Regency properties (where flush was original style), modern extensions requiring refined detailing.

Storm-Proof Casement Windows
Traditional rebated casements with storm-proof weather seals. Versatile system for cottages, Arts & Crafts, Victorian villas, or contemporary builds.

Key features:
• Rebated profile—sash sits proud of frame with visible moulding step
• 68mm frame depth accommodating double or vacuum glazing
• Side-hung, top-hung, or fixed configurations
• Multi-point espagnolette locking with concealed keeps (PAS 24 certified)
• Custom glazing bar patterns—period or contemporary layouts
• Decorative ovolo or chamfered mouldings to match existing property details
• 10-year factory paint finish and hardware guarantee

When to specify: Victorian cottages, Arts & Crafts homes, barn conversions, new builds requiring traditional character,ywhere flush profiles aren't required.

Difference explained: Flush casements sit level with frame (refined, minimal). Storm-proof casements have visible moulding step (more traditional cottage/Victorian look). Both achieve conservation approval and PAS 24 security—choice depends on property style and architectural requirement.
```

**WHY:** Lignum explains flush vs storm-proof clearly with visual descriptions. Added frame depths, explained visible difference ("flush" vs "moulding step"), added "When to specify" guidance, clarified both meet security/conservation standards.

## PAGE 3: VACUUM GLAZING HERO SECTION (NEW ADDITION FOR MULTIPLE PAGES)

**LOCATION:** Add to Windows, Doors, Alu-Clad, and Choices pages

**NEW SECTION:**
```
Vacuum Glazing: The Heritage Performance Breakthrough

For decades, heritage and conservation projects faced a compromise: authentic slim glazing with poor thermal performance, or chunky triple glazing that looked wrong. Vacuum glazing solves this.

How Vacuum Glazing Works:
Two panes of glass with a vacuum-sealed cavity between them. No air = no heat loss through convection. Micro-pillars (0.2mm diameter, spaced every 25mm) hold the panes apart. Total thickness: just 6.15mm—thinner than standard 24mm double glazing.

Performance Benefits:
• U-value: 0.49 W/m²K (better than triple glazing's 0.8 W/m²K)
• Acoustic reduction: Up to 36dB (blocks traffic noise, aircraft noise, street noise)
• Slim profile: 6.15mm total thickness vs 24mm double glazing (75% thinner)
• Heritage compliance: Approved by conservation officers for listed buildings
• No condensation: Vacuum seal eliminates internal misting
• Long lifespan: 25+ year expected service life with 15-year warranty

Where Vacuum Glazing Excels:
✓ Listed buildings requiring slim glazing with modern performance
✓ Conservation areas with strict appearance requirements
✓ Box sash windows where weight is critical (vacuum glass weighs ~40% less than triple glazing)
✓ Georgian/Regency properties requiring authentic slim sightlines
✓ Noise-sensitive locations (urban streets, flight paths, busy roads)
✓ High-performance new builds achieving Passivhaus standards

Cost & Availability:
Vacuum glazing adds approximately £200–£400 per m² over standard double glazing. Available as upgrade option for all sash, casement, and door systems. 15-year warranty included.

Technical Specification:
• Manufactured to BS EN 1279 (sealed glazing units)
• Thermal performance tested to BS EN 674
• Acoustic performance tested to BS EN ISO 140-3
• Meets Building Regulations Part L (thermal) and Part Q (security when laminated)
• Center-pane U-value: 0.49 W/m²K (whole-window U-value: 0.8–1.0 W/m²K depending on frame)

Comparison Table:

| Glazing Type | U-value (W/m²K) | Thickness | Acoustic (dB) | Heritage Approval | Cost |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|------|
| Single Glazed | 5.8 | 4mm | 28dB | ✓ (original) | Baseline |
| Double Glazed | 1.2 | 24mm | 32dB | ✗ (too thick) | +£50/m² |
| Vacuum Glazed | 0.49 | 6.15mm | 36dB | ✓ (slim profile) | +£250/m² |
| Triple Glazed | 0.8 | 44mm | 38dB | ✗ (too thick) | +£150/m² |

Why It Matters:
Heritage buildings can achieve modern thermal performance without compromising authentic appearance. Homeowners reduce energy bills by 60–70% compared to single glazing. Planners and conservation officers approve slim profiles that maintain period character. Architects achieve Passivhaus standards in sensitive contexts.

## PAGE 5: ALU-CLAD PAGE IMPROVEMENTS

### SECTION 5.1: When to Choose Alu-Clad (NEW CLARITY)

**BEFORE:**
```
Where it works best:
• Contemporary new builds with large glass areas
• Exposed coastal or hilltop locations
• Low-maintenance requirements for rental or second homes
• Slim profiles with maximum daylight
• Projects requiring long-life warranties
```

**AFTER:**
```
When to Specify Alu-Clad (vs Pure Timber)

Choose Alu-Clad When:
✓ Coastal exposure—salt spray, high winds, driving rain (aluminium protects timber from moisture cycling)
✓ South-facing elevations—intense UV exposure degrades external paint (aluminium requires no repainting)
✓ Rental or second homes—absentee owners can't maintain 8–10 year external paint cycles
✓ Contemporary architecture—powder-coated RAL colours (anthracite grey, jet black, slate blue) suit modern aesthetics
✓ Large sliding/bi-fold systems—aluminium frame strength handles heavy glass panels without sagging
✓ Budget for 50+ year lifespan—higher initial cost justified by zero external maintenance and long-life performance

Choose Pure Timber When:
✓ Heritage buildings—conservation officers prefer authentic timber externally
✓ Traditional architecture—natural timber character suits period properties better than powder-coated aluminium
✓ Owner-occupied homes—capable of routine external painting every 8–10 years
✓ Lower initial budget—pure timber costs 20–30% less than alu-clad
✓ Repairable detailing—damaged timber mouldings can be replaced; aluminium cladding must be fully replaced

Cost Comparison (Typical 2.4m x 1.2m Casement Window):
• Pure Timber: £1,200–£1,800 installed
• Alu-Clad: £1,800–£2,600 installed
• Lifetime maintenance cost (60 years):
  - Pure Timber: £600 (6x external repaints @ £100 each)
  - Alu-Clad: £0 (no external painting required)
• Total cost of ownership: Similar over lifespan

Performance Comparison:
| Feature | Pure Timber | Alu-Clad Timber |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| U-value | 1.0–1.2 W/m²K | 1.1–1.3 W/m²K (aluminium conducts heat slightly) |
| External maintenance | Paint every 8–10 years | None (occasional wash) |
| Coastal durability | Good (with regular maintenance) | Excellent (aluminium barrier) |
| Heritage approval | ✓ Preferred | ✗ Rarely approved for listed buildings |
| Repairability | High (individual components) | Low (cladding bonded to timber) |
| Lifespan | 60+ years (well-maintained) | 80+ years (no moisture cycling) |
| Internal appearance | Natural timber | Natural timber (identical) |

Thermal Bridge Note:
Aluminium conducts heat 1,000x faster than timber. Alu-clad systems have slight thermal bridging at frame edges—typically 0.1–0.2 W/m²K higher U-value than pure timber. For Passivhaus projects, specify thermally broken aluminium cladding or pure timber with external cladding panels (reduces thermal bridge).

Recommendation:
For most UK homes, pure timber offers best value and heritage compliance. Specify alu-clad for exposed coastal locations, contemporary new builds, or where long-term maintenance is impractical.
```

**WHY:** Lignum explains "when to choose" clearly. Added:
- Clear decision matrix (coastal/rental/contemporary vs heritage/traditional/budget)
- Cost comparison (initial + lifetime maintenance = similar total cost)
- Performance table (U-value, maintenance, durability, heritage, repair)
- Thermal bridge warning (0.1–0.2 W/m²K penalty)
- Honest guidance (pure timber works for most homes; alu-clad for specific situations)

### SECTION 6.2: Glazing Bars—Heritage Guidance (IMPROVED)

**BEFORE:**
```
Glazing Options
• Heritage Double Glazing: Slimline units suitable for conservation areas
• Vacuum Glazing: U-value 0.49 W/m²K with 6.15mm profile
• Triple Glazing: Maximum thermal performance
• Acoustic Glass: Noise reduction up to 42dB
```

**AFTER:**
```
Glazing Bars & Heritage Compliance

Glazing bars (muntins) divide glass into smaller panes—essential for listed buildings and conservation areas requiring authentic period appearance.

Bar Types:
• Through-pane bars: Individual small panes separated by timber bars (authentic 18th/19th century method)
  - Most authentic appearance
  - Higher cost (multiple sealed units per window)
  - Thermal performance: U-value 1.4–1.6 W/m²K (air gaps between panes reduce insulation)
  - Best for: Strict listed building consent, Georgian townhouses, heritage purists

• Applied bars: Timber bars applied to internal and external glass surface with spacer bar inside sealed unit
  - Convincing authentic appearance at 2m viewing distance
  - Single sealed unit (better thermal performance: U-value 0.9–1.2 W/m²K)
  - Lower cost than through-pane
  - Best for: Conservation areas, Victorian/Edwardian properties, replica replacements

• Astragal bars: Removable timber bars clipped onto internal glass surface only
  - Contemporary aesthetic (visible from inside, clean glass outside)
  - Easy to remove for glass cleaning
  - Best for: Modern extensions, where heritage appearance isn't required

Bar Patterns (Common Layouts):
• Georgian: Small equal panes (6-over-6, 8-over-8, 12-over-12 sash patterns)
• Victorian: Larger lower pane with decorative upper panes (2-over-2, 4-over-1 patterns)
• Cottage/Arts & Crafts: Leaded diamond panes or decorative margin lights
• Contemporary: Horizontal or vertical single bars, or no bars (plain glazing)

Conservation Guidance:
Listed building consent typically requires:
✓ Matching existing bar pattern and spacing (we measure and replicate exactly)
✓ Slimline bars (15–20mm visible width) not chunky modern profiles
✓ Putty glazing appearance (not visible gaskets or beads)
✓ Through-pane bars for Grade I/II* buildings (applied bars usually acceptable for Grade II)

Planning officers often require:
✓ 1:20 scale drawings showing bar patterns and frame profiles
✓ Samples of proposed bars, paint colours, and glazing
✓ Heritage statement explaining design approach
We prepare all required documentation and attend planning meetings if needed.

Cost Implications:
• Plain glazing: Baseline cost
• Applied bars: +£80–£150 per m²
• Through-pane bars: +£200–£350 per m²
• Decorative leaded/stained glass: +£300–£600 per m² (bespoke designs)

Recommendation:
For conservation areas: Applied bars achieve authentic appearance with better thermal performance and lower cost than through-pane. For listed buildings: Check planning guidance—through-pane may be required for principal elevations; applied bars often acceptable for rear/side elevations.
```

**WHY:** Lignum explains glazing bar types with "when to choose" guidance. Added:
- Clear definitions (through-pane vs applied vs astragal)
- Thermal performance comparison (1.4–1.6 vs 0.9–1.2 W/m²K)
- Heritage approval requirements (Grade I/II* vs Grade II)
- Cost ranges (+£80–£350/m² depending on type)
- Planning documentation requirements (1:20 drawings, samples, heritage statement)
- Honest recommendation (applied bars work for most conservation projects)

• Timber arrives from FSC®-certified suppliers (moisture content checked to 12–14%)
• CNC machining for precision profiles and joints
• Hand finishing (sanding, moulding crisp edges, fitting hardware)
• Factory paint application (3-coat microporous system, cured and inspected)
• Glazing (sealed units fitted with thermal spacer bars)
• Quality inspection (every window/door checked against specification)

We send progress photos at key milestones (timber machining, paint finish, glazed units). You're welcome to visit our workshop to see your windows during manufacture.

6. Installation (1–5 Days Depending on Project Size)
Our installers:
• Protect floors, carpets, and furniture with dust sheets
• Remove existing windows/doors carefully (salvaging hinges/hardware if requested)
• Install new frames with correct fixing, sealing, and insulation
• Fit glazed units with security beads and weather seals
• Adjust hinges, locks, and handles for smooth operation
• External silicone sealing and paint touch-ups
• Remove all waste and packaging
• Clean glass and demonstrate operation/maintenance

Building Control inspection arranged if required (we provide U-value certificates and compliance documentation).

7. Aftercare (Lifetime Relationship)
• 6-week check-in call (any adjustment needed?)
• 12-month inspection (paint finish, hardware operation, draught seals)
• Maintenance guide provided (cleaning, lubrication, minor adjustments)
• Lifetime technical support (we're here if you need advice or spare parts)

Our guarantees remain valid for life of property—transferable to new owners if you sell.

Typical Project Timelines:
• Single entrance door: 8–10 weeks (survey to installation)
• Full-house window replacement: 12–16 weeks (includes planning if conservation area)
• Extension doors (bi-fold/French): 10–12 weeks (coordination with builder required)

Lead times may extend during peak season (March–June). We'll confirm exact schedule at quotation stage.

**WHY:** Lignum's process clarity builds confidence. This section:
- Explains exactly what happens at each stage (1–2 hour survey, 5–7 day quotation, 8–12 week manufacture)
- Demystifies survey visit (laser measurement, photographs, rot testing)
- Lists quotation contents (itemized pricing, alternatives, U-values, lead times, guarantees)
- Explains manufacture process (CNC machining, hand finishing, paint curing, quality inspection)
- Clarifies installation (dust sheets, waste removal, Building Control coordination)
- Adds aftercare (6-week check-in, 12-month inspection, lifetime support)
- Realistic timelines (8–16 weeks depending on project)
- "No pressure" reassurance (quotations valid 90 days, we advise not push)

### 1. Certification & Compliance Language (Add Throughout)
✓ PAS 24:2016 certified—tested to resist forced entry for minimum 3 minutes
✓ Secured by Design approved (Police-preferred specification)
✓ Building Regulations compliant (Document Q, L, M)
✓ BS 6375 weather performance tested
✓ BS EN 1279 sealed glazing units
✓ BSI ISO 9001 quality management

### 2. Vacuum Glazing Positioning (Hero Feature)
✓ U-value 0.49 W/m²K (better than triple glazing's 0.8 W/m²K)
✓ 6.15mm thickness (75% thinner than 24mm double glazing)
✓ Acoustic reduction up to 36dB (traffic noise, aircraft, urban streets)
✓ Heritage compliance (approved for listed buildings requiring slim sightlines)
✓ Cost premium: £200–£400/m² over standard double glazing
✓ 15-year warranty

### 3. "Forest to Frame" Sustainability Narrative
✓ FSC®-certified timber from responsible forestry
✓ Timber stores ~1 tonne CO₂ per cubic meter
✓ Embodied carbon: Timber 60 kgCO₂/m² vs uPVC 120 vs aluminium 180
✓ Engineered cores use 100% of log (no waste)
✓ Designed for 60+ year lifespan (vs uPVC 20–30 years)
✓ Repairable, refinishable, renewable (not landfill after 30 years)

### 4. "When to Choose" Decision Guidance
✓ Box sash vs spring balance sash (authentic mechanism vs space constraints)
✓ Flush casement vs storm-proof casement (refined vs traditional appearance)
✓ French vs bifold vs sliding doors (opening width, heritage, cost)
✓ Pure timber vs alu-clad (heritage compliance vs coastal durability)
✓ Through-pane vs applied glazing bars (listed building consent vs cost/thermal)

### 5. Process & Reassurance Messaging
✓ What happens during site survey (1–2 hours, laser measurement, photos)
✓ What's included in quotation (itemized pricing, alternatives, U-values, lead times)
✓ Manufacture timeline (8–12 weeks with progress photos)
✓ Installation process (dust protection, Building Control coordination, waste removal)
✓ Aftercare support (6-week check-in, 12-month inspection, lifetime technical support)

### 6. Performance Quantification
✓ PAS 24 tested for minimum 3-minute forced entry resistance
✓ Multi-point locking: 3-point or 5-point with shootbolts, hooks, deadlocks
✓ Acoustic glass: up to 42dB reduction (standard 32dB, vacuum 36dB, acoustic laminated 42dB)
✓ Thermal performance: U-value ranges (single 5.8, double 1.2, vacuum 0.49, triple 0.8 W/m²K)
✓ Paint finish: 10-year guarantee against flaking, peeling, cracking
✓ Timber warranty: 30-year rot/fungal (Accoya® 50-year)

### 7. Cost Transparency
✓ Vacuum glazing: +£200–£400/m² premium
✓ Applied glazing bars: +£80–£150/m²
✓ Through-pane bars: +£200–£350/m²
✓ Alu-clad: +30% initial cost vs pure timber (but zero lifetime external maintenance)
✓ Typical ranges: Casement window £1,200–£1,800, Entrance door £3,500–£6,000, Bifold set £8,000–£15,000
