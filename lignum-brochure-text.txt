All Lignum timber is sustainably sourced and carefully processed 
to ensure long-term environmental value. Our preferred timber is engineered for strength, stability and minimal waste — delivering a material that’s as responsible as it is beautiful.
We work exclusively with suppliers who meet FSC® certiﬁ  cation 
standards. From forest management to frame production, our commitment to sustainability runs through the entire chain. Timber offcuts are recycled, ﬁ  nishes are water-based, and our carbon footprint is kept low.
Why energy efﬁ  ciency from natural timber matters
There’s never been a better moment to 
futureproof your home.
With stricter building regulations and a 
national drive toward net-zero, energy efﬁ  ciency isn’t just a bonus, it’s a necessity. From heat retention to summer cooling, timber windows and doors are an essential part of building a smarter, more sustainable home.
Upgrading your glazing can dramatically 
reduce heat loss, bring down your bills, and create a more comfortable environment year-round. By using sustainably sourced, wooden windows and doors you’re also choosing a material that is a natural carbon store and has the lowest embodied carbon of any window or door frame. It’s also crafted to last for generations to for a net-zero impact on the environment.

Your front door sets the tone for your entire home. It’s more than a 
point of entry. It’s your ﬁ  rst impression, your welcome, and a fabulous way to express personal style. With Lignum’s handcrafted timber doors, you can create a statement entrance that’s both beautiful and long-lasting.
Choose a Style That Complements Your Home
Start by considering the architectural style 
of your property. Traditional homes often suit classic panelled door designs with heritage ironmongery and period details, while modern or contemporary homes may call for minimalist lines, wide boards, or ﬂ  ush ﬁ  nishes.
For transitional properties, those 
blending old and new, look to updated traditional designs with a fresh twist: clean mouldings, bold colour, or a natural wood ﬁ  nish.
Make It Personal With ColourTimber offers the perfect canvas for colour. 
Whether you opt for a soft heritage shade, a dramatic black, or a bold red or blue, your choice can instantly elevate kerb appeal. You can even contrast your door colour with the frame or glazing bars for a bespoke touch, contrasting a stained door with a painted frame in a bold colour makes the natural wood pop out! 
Lignum’s painted ﬁ  nishes are durable, 
weather-resistant, and available in a wide range of custom colours.
Add Character with Decorative GlazingGlazing isn’t just functional, it can become 
a deﬁ  ning feature of your front door. From classic leaded or stained glass to sleek sandblasted or reeded styles, you can ﬁ  lter light, enhance privacy, or introduce a decorative motif that ties in with your home’s interior.
Finish with the Right HardwareHandles, letterplates, knockers, and hinges 
are the jewellery of your front door. In satin brass, antique bronze, polished chrome or black, they can transform a simple design into something timeless or bold. Choose pieces that match your preferred aesthetic — whether traditional, cottage-style or contemporary.
Design It with Conﬁ  denceWith Lignum, every entrance door is made 
to order, combining precision joinery with your choice of detailing. Choose from our curated collection of Lignum insulated timber entrance doors or go exclusive, with our Bespoke Entrances individually designed for your home.

property or designing your dream home from scratch, we’ll help you create an entrance door that’s both practical and deeply personal.How to Make an Entrance

When it comes to connecting your home to the outdoors, few features 
make as much impact as a well-designed timber door set. But which style suits your space best — bifold doors or French doors?
Both offer charm, warmth and long-lasting performance when made 
from sustainably sourced timber. The decision often comes down to how you want the space to feel and function.
Open Up With Bifolds
Timber bifold doors are ideal for larger 
openings and contemporary living spaces. The individual panels fold back and stack neatly to one or both sides, creating a wide, uninterrupted connection between indoors and out. If you’re designing a kitchen diner or open plan area leading to a patio or garden, bifolds help bring the outside in with maximum impact.
Bifolds are available in a wide range of 
conﬁ  gurations — from two to six panels — with the option to include a single trafﬁ  c door for everyday access. You can even create a classic French door look within a bifold format by choosing two centre opening panels that fold back on both sides. 
And with timber, there’s real ﬂ  exibility in 
design. Add traditional glazing bars or heritage detailing to achieve a period look, even in a modern setting.
Keep It Classic with French DoorsIf your project calls for a more traditional 
or compact solution, French doors are a timeless choice. Featuring two symmetrical doors that open outward or inward, they work beautifully in smaller openings or side returns and pair well with older properties.
Timber French doors offer excellent 
thermal performance, especially when paired with high performance glazing. They can be styled with feature bars or panel detailing to complementa Georgian, Edwardian or cottage aesthetic.
Which to Choose?■Choose bifold doors for: large 
openings, ﬂ  exible layouts, open plan living, and seamless garden access.
■Choose French doors for: classic proportions, compact spaces, period styling, or where full width access isn’t essential.
Whichever style suits your space, Lignum timber doors combine craftsmanship, character and thermal comfort — built to last and designed to impress.Timber Bifolds or French Doors:

Glazing is a key part of your window or door’s performance, and 
we don’t treat it as an afterthought. Our vacuum glazing options for example provide industry-leading levels of insulation, acoustic protection and UV ﬁ  ltering, while maintaining clarity and style.
Whether you’re working with large feature windows, restoring a listed 
property or simply want more peace and quiet, we’ll help you choose the right glazing spec. That includes acoustic, laminated, heritage, obscure and slimline units.
Glass options include:
■Vacuum glass for low U-values and 
noise reduction
■Laminated acoustic glass
■Slimline heritage double glazing
■Decorative and obscure styles
■Restoration glass for period accuracy
Upgrade Your Home with Vacuum Glazing
Timber windows and doors offer lasting 
quality and natural insulation. But to get the most from your investment, pairing your Lignum timber frames with vacuum glazing takes energy efﬁ  ciency and comfort to the next level.
Unlike double or triple glazing, vacuum 
glass uses just two panes of glass separated by a microscopic vacuum layer. This slim, lightweight construction delivers outstanding thermal performance with U-values as low as 0.49 W/m²K, more than twice as efﬁ  cient as standard double glazing.
This helps reduce heat loss, cut energy 
bills, and create a more stable indoor temperature, all without the added weight or bulk of triple glazing. Its lighter construction is easier on hinges and hardware and enables slimmer proﬁ  les that suit heritage properties and conservation areas.
Best for cutting out noiseVacuum glass also enhances comfort 
with excellent acoustic insulation — independently tested to reduce external noise by up to 36 dB. Combined with the natural sound-absorbing qualities of timber, this makes your home noticeably quieter and more restful.
With up to 80% light transmission, 
vacuum glass keeps interiors bright while maintaining clean, uncluttered glazing. The absence of bulky spacers or a third pane means better clarity and less visible hardware — ideal for large windows, sliding doors, or glazed extensions.
Each unit is warrantied for 15 years and 
designed to perform well beyond 25 years. Vacuum glass is fully compatible with all Lignum timber windows and doors, whether you’re building new or upgrading existing frames.The Art of Glass
