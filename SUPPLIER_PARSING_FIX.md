📋 **Supplier Parsing Fix - Test Instructions**

## ✅ Issue Fixed
The supplier quote parsing failure has been resolved! The problem was a data structure mismatch between the parsing function and the ML service endpoints.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed
- **Root Cause**: `parse_quote_lines_from_text()` returns a dictionary with structure `{lines: [...], estimated_total: X}`, but the endpoint was expecting just a list of lines
- **Solution**: Updated endpoints to properly extract `lines` array and `estimated_total` from the returned dictionary
- **Testing**: Verified parsing works with multiple table formats

## 🧪 Test Results
The parsing now correctly extracts:
```
Door Handle: 2.0 @ £25.0 = £50.0
Window Frame: 1.0 @ £200.0 = £200.0
Total: £250.0
```

## 🚀 Ready to Test
1. **ML Service**: Running on `http://localhost:8000` with fixes applied
2. **Endpoints**: `/parse-supplier-quote` and `/debug-parse` now working correctly
3. **Quote Builder**: Should now properly extract line items from supplier PDFs

## 🔍 How to Verify
1. Upload your "Joinery ai example supplier quote.pdf" to the Quote Builder
2. Click "Parse supplier PDFs" 
3. You should now see individual line items extracted instead of the "no_lines_detected" error
4. The parsed lines should show in the right panel with proper quantities and prices

## 📝 Next Steps
- Test with your actual supplier PDF
- Verify line items are extracted correctly
- Check that the mapping to questionnaire fields works
- Proceed with generating the customer proposal

The supplier quote parsing is now working correctly! 🎉
